# Friends

Building a decentralized world, together with friends.

## What is Friends?

**Friends** is a program to build mentorship, friendship, partnership to help people learn knowledge and collaborate in decentralized technology.

The program is completely **free**, but you can always donate to the mentors if you want to.

## Why this program?

- **decentralized technology is hard**, it's hard to learn, hard to build, hard to collaborate. We need to help each other to make it easier.
- **rebuild the trust of Web3**, too many people drained the crypto ecosystem and leave. We need to rebuild the trust and make it a better place, less hype, more substance.

### Who should apply?

- **Mentor**: you are an experienced developer/creator/manager in decentralized technology, you want to help others to learn and build.
- **Mentee**: you are eager to commit yourself to Web3 and build a better world, but don't know much about it, and want to start and grow quickly.
